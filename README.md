This project is about working and analyzing the departure delays for United Airlines flights where we study both efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this project we compare the relationship of departure delays with six various factors and perform exploratory data analysis and perform.
The six various factors that we are comparing with the relationship between departure delays are :
1. Time of day
2. Time of Year
3. Temperature
4. Wind speed
5. Precipitation
6. Visibility
These factors are chosen because departure delays of flights are based on hours, seasons, temperature conditions, wind speed , whether it is raining or not and the visibility conditions
